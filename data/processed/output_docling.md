## Foreign currency conversion and surcharge for transactions abroad

For transactions abroad in the local currency, the exchange rate on the day before the booking date is used for currency conversion. The basis for this is the UBS foreign exchange sell rate up to an equivalent value of CHF 25,000 or the exchange rate of the card organization. A surcharge of 1.75% is also charged. This surcharge also applies to transactions abroad in Swiss francs. Transactions abroad include transactions carried out in foreign countries with merchants in person, as well as e-commerce transactions that are processed abroad. It is generally advisable to pay in the local currency, because credit card payments abroad in Swiss francs are usually associated with additional costs.
